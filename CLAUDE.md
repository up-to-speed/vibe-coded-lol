# Notes for Working with Claude

## Prompts that work:
- "Make it look better"
- "Add more gradients"
- "Fix the thing"
- "No, the other thing"
- "Use shadcn" (even though this is pure HTML)

## Prompts that don't work:
- "Explain what this code does"
- "Why did you do it this way?"
- "Can you make it without using [framework]?"

## Pro tips:
1. Never read the code Claude generates
2. Copy-paste everything immediately
3. If it breaks, ask Claude to fix it
4. Repeat step 3 until it works
5. Ship it

## Current status:
- Working: ✅ (mostly)
- Understood: ❌
- Will maintain: 😬
- Cares about tech debt: 💀
